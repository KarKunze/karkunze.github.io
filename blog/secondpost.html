    <h1>The z-index</h1>
    <br /> Using a framework like Bootstrap has great possibilities and can deliver polished results for even the novice developer. While responsive design that looks great in mobile--how most users will be viewing a website--is relatively simple in Bootstrap,
    sometimes things happen for which the beginning web developer may not be prepared. One of these things can be related to how items are layered along the z-axis of the document. This relative positioning is the z-index.<br />
    <div>
      <br /></div>
    <div>
      Positioned elements, or elements who's positioned value is anything other than static, are layered along the z-axis of the page. Think of the elements as being layered on top of the page, with some layers overlapping. It is why when you change the opacity
      of an item, you will begin to see the image or text of the element beneath it.&nbsp;</div>

      One of my favorite things about Bootstrap's responsive design is the toggler in the navbar. Now imagine you've carefully designed a webpage that you think works and then when you click the toggler on your mobile device, nothing happens. Or does it? What
      if the menu opens, but it opens under the next element along that z-axis? The menu still exists, but the user can not access it because it is buried beneath the next element. This is where the z-index comes in.&nbsp;</div>
    <div>
      <br /></div>
    <div>
      The z-index is the order in which the elements in the document. The higher the number, the closer to the top of the layers of a webpage an element is. In order to bring a layer closer to the top, assign a higher z-index to the element.&nbsp;</div>

        Knowledge of how the elements in a document are stacked can both alleviate issues and help one create more dynamic websites.</div>
