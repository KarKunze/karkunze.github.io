        <h1>The First Post: Why I Joined a Web Developer Bootcamp</h1>

<br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Last week I started a coding bootcamp. This is why I will be making periodic blog posts on a number of technical topics related to my learning, which is out of my comfort zone, much as the last two weeks have been. Next time I will compare some of the free online coding tutorials; &nbsp;however, for this first post, I am going to explain why I joined a web developer bootcamp. This post is not technical, but it's the one I need to write first in a blog that tracks a journey in learning how to use a particular class of technology. I hope that the last post I write in this blog has a positive ending as a narrative bookend to this one.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">I am 43 years old, and I have zero coding experience. All I have ever done since graduating with a M.Ed. is teach, however the career--the fundamental changes in it over the last two decades&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">and the resulting lack of work-life balance--started to take a toll on me. I have been contemplating a career switch for the last few years, but lacked the courage to take a chance that I would fail. Then, the past year of my life was a series of difficulties, pain, sacrifice, and loss. I gave everything that I could--emotionally, physically, mentally, and financially--until I had nothing left but the love of my family. I had decided I could no longer continue doing the same thing. I had to make a change that would be better for myself and my family.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Change is a whole lot harder than just wishing it were so. After a couple of months of trying to make that transition from teacher of 18 years to something else, I had come to the conclusion that I was going to have to further my education in another field if I was going to have a comparable salary to the one I was leaving behind and to be&nbsp;</span>satisfied in my work<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; That is when I came across an advertisement for a coding bootcamp near me. I knew that it would take me years to finish a degree program while working jobs that would barely allow me to make ends meet, so I decided to attend an informational session on this bootcamp that promised that even a novice like me could learn enough coding to get a job in twelve weeks for around a thousand dollars a week.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">That was too rich for my blood, and however intriguing the prospect, I had no intention of applying for the bootcamp at that moment. Then a misunderstanding in the communication of my email address led to a text, a few emails, the first of several coding challenges, and an interview. By this time I was persuaded that perhaps I could do this and that it would be worth borrowing the money to try. After all, I would be borrowing money for a degree program if I decided to go that way. So I signed up.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">My husband encouraged me to try, and Nick and Ross were so positive, that here I am, two weeks in. I almost did not join this bootcamp from the beginning, and I almost dropped out during the php pre-work and before signing the payment plan. And right now, in this moment in time, I feel that I have made a mistake because I can't visualize myself being able to achieve success at the end of the camp, no matter how had I work. Even with three or four hours every evening after class and eight hours a day on the weekends, I can't see myself learning enough in the next ten weeks to keep up in class, let alone do this professionally. I am at maximum anxiety and frustration levels. Over the next ten weeks and with a lot of hard work and perseverance, perhaps that will change.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">The fellow members of my class have been kind, encouraging, and helpful. They all have previous coding experience, if even as a hobby, so their coaching has been very helpful. A psychologist by the name of Lev Vygotsky put forth an incomplete but fairly widely accepted theory that the potential for cognitive development depends on the "zone of proximal development" (ZPD), illustrated here in figure 1.</span><br />

The zone of proximal development is "the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem-solving under adult guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers" (Vygotsky, Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes). We can apply this theory to adults. Learning takes place in the ZPD. If you give any person a task that he or she can already do, then he or she is not learning. If you give any person a task that he or she cannot do even with help, then he or she is also not learning and will become frustrated. Learning happens when a person is given a task they cannot do on their own, but can complete with help. Then with the proper support, tools, practice and acquisition of skill, the ZPD changes and edges outward.  <span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: #333333;"><br /></span>
<span style="color: #333333;">Learning happens in the ZPD, but something else happens further out from the ZPD (figure 2).</span></span><br />

<br />
At this moment in time, class work is being completed in the the ZPD for many fellow members of the cohort, but for me much of it is too far out to be the ZPD. I use much of my out of class time trying to gain the knowledge I am missing. However, as projects pile up and everything takes me twice as long (or more) as everyone else, I am currently in what Tom Senninger termed "the panic zone." Everything is moving so fast and while I have attempted to make accommodations for my needs, each time I do not (and perhaps at that moment cannot) meet expectations my anxiety level grows until I am in a panic spiral that encompasses my entire future and what failing here does to my financial health and my ability to support my family. Instead of learning to my potential, I spend precious resources questioning, "What was I thinking in the first place?" This of course then affects my sleep, my emotional health, my cognitive processing, and makes what is already difficult even more so.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that is just part of the process for me. Perhaps I am around the corner from an "aha moment" and I will look back at this and scoff for how much anxiety I was feeling about a little struggle. All I know to do now is to push through it and not be afraid of the reaction I get from questions<br />
that seem obvious. No matter what, I will continue to work as hard as I can and do my best, and hopefully, with the support of those who know more, my ZPD will start to overlap the rest of my cohort. Until then, I will continue to do JavaScript tutorials until the syntax sticks and I can understand more clearly a loop within a loop.<br />
