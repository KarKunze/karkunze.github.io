      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>After 18 years as a teacher, I am going back into a classroom in the role of student. While it is a little daunting to choose a new path and leave the one I have known for so long, I have a wonderful and supportive husband who encouraged me to be brave enough to embark upon a new adventure. I am excited to see what the future holds.<p>
